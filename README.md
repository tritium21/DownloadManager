DownloadManager
===============

[![Python version](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Python&message=3.10&color=3776AB&style=plastic&logo=python&labelColor=FFDC55 "Python version: 3.10")](http://python.org)

An [aiohttp](https://docs.aiohttp.org/) based server for
downloading files to the remote system, without being
horribly slow or obviously insecure -- hopefully.

Probably don't use this in a high volume environment,
but you do you, boo.
