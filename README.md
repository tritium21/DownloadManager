DownloadManager
===============

An [aiohttp](https://docs.aiohttp.org/) based server for
downloading files to the remote system, without being
horribly slow or obviously insecure -- hopefully.

Probably don't use this in a high volume environment,
but you do you, boo.

> Note: No back end code has been written, look elsewhere
